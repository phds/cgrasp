This work is part of design of continuous greedy randomized adaptive search procedure 
(C-GRASP). A major problem in stochastic local search algorithms is moving from solution to solution in the space of candidate solutions to guarantees the best solution. Implementations to find a minimum or maximum of a multi-modal function more efficiently is employed using a C library called MPFR due precision interval arithmetic. C-GRASP is a multi-start procedure covering the greedy approach construction of solution improved by a line search method, and then tuning the solution with a local search consisting look the portion of the neighbourhood of the current solution to reach the better solution than the previous. A library GNU-style using C++ library and Python wrapper is implemented for this purpose. Evaluation results show that the proposed improvement is more accurate.
